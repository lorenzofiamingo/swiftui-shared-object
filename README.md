# SwiftUI SharedObject üç±

`@SharedObject` is an alternative to `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` to handle `ObservableObject`.
If you need to have multiple objects of the same class persisted among multiple view instances, it's difficult to handle the situation with other wrappers: with `@StateObject` the object will deinit with the view and be generated only for the specific view instance, with `@EnvironmentObject` you can bind only one instance of the same class for each Environment and with `@ObservedObject` is difficult to propagate object in nested views.

`@SharedObject` simply stores the objects using an identifier, so you can retrieve it each time you'll need it.

## Usage

Retrieve the shared object with the given id or, if not present, create a shared object with an initial value:
```swift
@SharedObject("A") var letterA = Letter()
```
If you are sure that the object is already been created you can just retrieve the shared object:
```swift
@SharedObject("A") var letterA: Letter
```
You can give a default initial value to the class, so you don't need to specify in each view you think the object will be created:
```swift
final class Letter: SharableObject {

  var value: String
		
  init(_ value: String) {
	self.value = value
  }
		
  static var initialValue: Self {
	.init("A")
  }
}
```
